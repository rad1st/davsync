# DavSync
DavSync: like rsync, for WebDAV.

# About:
DavSync is a small, self-contained tool for synchronizing local folders with
remote folders via the WebDAV protocol. It requires only Python ~~2.7~~ 3, and is
fully contained in the davsync file in order to make it easy to just copy to a
server and start using it.

DavSync was initially developed to facilitate uploading data to
[OpenDrive](https://www.opendrive.com/) from a Synology NAS, and has really
only been tested in this use-case, however it should work with any other WebDAV
compliant server.

DavSync was inspired by the excellent [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
utility, though makes no claim to be as robust or well-engineered as it is.

# Usage:
```
usage: davsync [-h] [-v] [-l LOGIN] [-p PASSWORD] url srcPath dstPath

positional arguments:
  url                   URL to sync with
  srcPath               path to sync from (use "wd:" for remote)
  dstPath               path to sync to (use "wd:" for remote)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         use verbose output
  -l LOGIN, --login LOGIN
                        login username (typically email address)
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        password for remote server

Example: ./davsync -l username -p password https://any.owncloud.site ~/photos wd:remote.php/dav/files/username/photos
```
